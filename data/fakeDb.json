This laptop is heads and shoulders above the Alienware 17 R5 that it replaces. It games with ease, it edits video with ease, it handles everything I've thrown at it with ease. All the while amazing me with the a 4K, 120Hz LCD that is not of this earth. Way to go Razer!",

    "review": "I spent the last couple of months going back and forth, reading and watching reviews, checking out pricing. I have used Surface's, Dells, HP's, Macbook Pro's, and even MSI gaming laptops. Knowing this computer was on the expensive end left me tentative. Well I finally bought it and could not be happier. The fit and finish is very high quality. It has proven quite capable and I like how easy it is to customize. Pretty much the only drawback I could find was the lack of a number pad but even with that missing I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this laptop to anyone interested.",

    "review": "The closest thing I have found to the excellent build quality of a MacBook Pro. Very solid an inflexible unibody construction and very high end components. However, it is clear that Razor has an engineering staff of nine geniuses and one idiot. In an incredibly boneheaded and unjustifiable move, they have reversed the labeling on the keys. For some asinine reason that serves no purpose other than to make your life miserable, they decided to place the symbols BELOW the numbers instead of above.",

    "review": "I'm a power user and enjoy working on great equipment. This laptop delivers. Expensive, but worth it. Excellent cooling capability and bests most notebooks in a portable package. This system replaced an Alienware 17 R5 which was much heavier, bulkier, warmer, and louder. I was a little concerned about going from a 4K display to a 1080p 300Hz display, but I'm very happy with my selection. I had a few applications that didn't scale well on 4K, and this display looks fantastic.",

    "review": " I have 1 very big issues with the laptop I received. The first being the fact that the screen cannot stay on with the charger unplugged. I've tried different battery and display drivers, tried Recalibrating the charge sensor as suggested by reddit, and tried adjusting power saving settings. Since I use it mostly for gaming this is fine since it's just known that gaming laptops should be plugged in while in heavy use. But if I need to move around the house working with roommates, it's plenty annoying to have to carry around the charger.",

It's still great tho. There's not that many gaming pcs that have a sleek design. I'm really happy with my purchase. The big screen is wonderful",
